           <p><em>1. Foster the creative habits of mind</em></p>
  <p style="text-align: left">Our projects so far have given us much ability to foster creative habits. The prompts are so open-ended that they allow us to make pretty much whatever our heart desires. It really helped to have a template we could work with and manipulate to fit our needs. Because I wasn't worried about starting a program from scratch, it gave me more time to find inspiration around me and dream up whatever theme I wanted for each of my projects.</p>
        </div>
            <div class="col-sm-4">
        <p><em>2. Engage with others in a workshop environment.</em></p>
  <p style="text-align: left">After each project, we were able to share what we worked on in small groups. It was less intimidating to talk about my processes to just a couple of people, and then when they responded in a positive way it gave me the confidence to share my work with the class as a whole. It was also really helpful to see cool things that others had included, and then be able to ask them how they had done it. Those small things could then inspire parts of our next projects.</p>
        </div>
          <div class="col-sm-4">
        <p><em>3.	Think deeply about craft. </em></p>
  <p style="text-align: left">The course readings helped in creating the projects. Oftentimes, I would have an idea that gave me a head start on whatever topic I wanted to center my project on. But when I would think about what I had read in the readings, it gave me ideas to add that helped to enhance the projects. This was very evident in my New Media Webtext Experiment, where I created more of an artsy piece to just look at. But after seeing the emphasis on interactivity in the readings, I chose to include hyperlinks that would help the audience engage more with the environment I was trying to produce.</p>

    <div class="col-sm-4">
        <p><em>4. Engage in sustained research and skills development. </em></p>
  <p style="text-align: left">These projects involved a lot of research and skills development. For example, the act of creating the websites used a lot of critical thinking. I found myself including many snippets of code from the template, but then having to either search online how to manipulate it or go into the css style sheet to make it look how I intended. One main thing I learned from the act of creating was the relationship with the usage of classes, and I also got a lot more comfortable not only with html but also css code.</p>
        </div>
            <div class="col-sm-4">
        <p><em>5. Learn to present your work</em></p>
  <p style="text-align: left">Not only did we work on presenting our work to others while giving small speeches on the context, but our projects needed to be able to tell their own story without speech. This seemed to play a lot in to user experience design. I had to make sure that the content of my text and the layout of my websites could aid in instructing the user where to look and where to click.</p>

  <h4><em>1. Foster the creative habits of mind</em></h4>
  <p style="text-align: left">The projects have allowed us to expand even further on our creativity. While having a template for the first set of projects was nice, the lack of a template for this next set really allowed for full creative potential. Using the final project theme as a guide was helpful in not getting too overwhelmed by all of the possibilities. We were able to fully explore the different softwares to make whatever we wanted to in regards to our final project theme.</p>
     <br>
        <h4><em>2.	Engage with others in a workshop environment</em></h4>
  <p style="text-align: left">We continued to share our making assignments with fellow classmates, which was great practice in being able to talk about our work. In addition, we started research on our final project topics. With this, we learned how to talk about our research and why it was important. With both topics, we could give and receive helpful feedback from our classmates. This was a way to gain advice for future iterations but also confidence in sharing with the larger group.</p>
      <br>
        <h4><em>3.	Think deeply about craft</em></h4>
  <p style="text-align: left">With the addition of doing research throughout this round of projects,we've been thinking a lot more about craft. We've learned to talk about things like conjectures, practices, theories, and methods. Thinking deeply about all of these things allowed us to become more efficient in sharing our projects and research as well. Having these things in mind also acted as a guide for what knowledge we took from our research as well.</p>
      <br>
            <h4><em>4.	Engage in sustained research and skills development. </em></h4>
  <p style="text-align: left">Research was a big part of our class throughout this last section. We conducted research on various matters all aiming towards our final project, whether that was research on the topic itself, or on how we would create the interactive experience. From week to week, we shared our progress, and then expanded on what we previously learned for the next week. At the same time, we were also further developing our skills in various Adobe softwares.</p>
      <br>
            <h4><em>5. Learn to present your work</em></h4>
  <p style="text-align: left">As we have continued producing making assignments and research updates, we have also continued to present our work to our fellow classmates. We start with a small group of peers, before having the opportunity to share with the class as a whole. Presentations also work best when our projects can kind of speak for themselves. By designing in a way that people know what they are seeing and supposed to be seeing, it takes some of the burden off of us having to explain as a presenter.</p>

  <div class="col-sm-4">
         <p><em>1. Foster the creative habits of mind</em></p>
<p style="text-align: left">Our final interactive installation projects allowed us to fully foster our creativity. By being given a toolkit to start off with, we had a lot of materials we could pick and choose to include in our project. Beyond the toolkit, W3 had many great resources to use. With the wealth of options we had to work with, we could truly make our installation look however we wanted it to. The possibilities for creative expression were endless.</p>
      </div>
          <div class="col-sm-4">
      <p><em>2. Engage with others in a workshop environment.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: left">We continued to work on workshopping with others during these last two projects. For example, when presenting our multimedia research presentation, we could tell the class our final plans for our installation project. Classmates would then ask questions that we might not have originally thought of, and we could take those perspectives into account when polishing up our projects.</p>
      </div>
        <div class="col-sm-4">
      <p><em>3.	Think deeply about craft. </em></p>
<p style="text-align: left">We had to think very deeply about our craft when designing our interactive installation. While our imaginations for what our installation would look like were limitless, we had to think about what we could realistically do with HTML and CSS code to create that image. There was also much to think about in terms of accessibility, and how our different design decisions could affect that as well. Luckily, I was able to use research from my research presentation to learn about how to best design the installation.</p>

  <div class="col-sm-4">
      <p><em>4. Engage in sustained research and skills development. </em></p>
<p style="text-align: left">We spent a month doing research to aid in our final project development. Each week I found an article to focus on three different areas. One would tell me why my topic was important, one would give me actual content to include, and the last would talk about the best design practices to make the project. As I got new ideas from each week's research, it would inform what I researched the next week. For example, one week I read about short stories being useful, so the next I researched how to best make a short story.</p>
      </div>
          <div class="col-sm-4">
      <p><em>5. Learn to present your work</em></p>
<p style="text-align: left">One of the biggest practices we had in presenting our work this semester was for our multimedia research presentations. After doing 4 weeks of research, we could figure out how to best package our findings up to then present them to the class. The presentation had to be 8-10 minutes, and I was very worried about figuring out how to speak for a long enough time to hit that requirement. Luckily, I was able to come up with enough material to present to do so.</p>
